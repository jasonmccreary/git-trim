# git trim
A command to quickly remove merged, pruned, untracked, or stale branches within a Git repository.

## Usage
```sh
git trim
git trim --pruned
git trim -p
# Removes local branches where its remote branch no longer exists

git trim --merged
git trim -m
# Removes local branches already merged into the current branch

git trim --stale
git trim -s
# Removes local branches without commits in the last 3 months

git trim --untracked
git trim -u
# Removes local branches not tracking a remote branch

git trim --reset[=remote]
# Removes all local branches except those existing on remote which defaults to "origin" (requires confirmation)

git trim --all
# Removes all local branches except the current branch (requires confirmation)
```

Of course, you may combine these options where appropriate. For example, `git trim --merged --stale`, would remove both local branches which have been merged with the current branch or are _stale_.

There are two additional options which may also be combined with the options above: `--tracked` and `--remote`.

When the `--tracked` (or `-t`) option is used, the remote tracking branch is also removed. For example, `git trim --merged --tracked` will remove local branches merged into the current branch, and remove the remote branch it's tracking (if any).

When the `--remote` (or `-r`) option is used, `git trim` will remove remote branches instead of local branches. For example, `git trim --stale --remote` will remove remote branches without commits in the last 3 months (stale local branches will not be removed).

Finally, you may also append the `--dry-run` option to any `git-trim` command to simply list the branches which would be deleted instead of actually removing them.

## Installation

### Basic install
The preferred installation method is to simply save the `git-trim` script somewhere included in your path. For example, copy `git-trim` into an existing included path like `/usr/local/bin`, or add the parent directory to your `PATH` environment.

### Installing via NPM
```sh
npm install --global git-trim
```

### Installing via ZSH

#### [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)

1. Run: `git clone https://github.com/jasonmccreary/git-trim.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/git-trim`
2. Add `git-trim` to your plugin list: edit `~/.zshrc` and change
   `plugins=(...)` to `plugins=(... git-trim)`

## Updating
Once installed, the easiest way to update is to overwrite your local copy with the latest contents of the `git-trim` script.

### Updating via NPM
```sh
npm update --global git-trim
```

### Updating via ZSH

#### Oh-My-Zsh
```sh
cd $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/git-trim
git fetch
git pull
```

## Configuration
By default, `git trim` will never remove the current branch. However, depending on your branching strategy, you may have additional branches you never want to remove. For example, a `dev` or `staging` branch.

If so, you may set a `gt.exclude` option to your Git configuration, either locally or globally, with a space delimited string of any additional branches you want to exclude from removal.

```sh
git config gt.exclude "dev staging"
# Always exclude the "dev" and "staging" branches from removal
```

## Disclaimer
Some of the options in this command remove branches without warning. Once a branch is removed, it might not be recoverable. You are solely responsible when running this command.

There are thousands of commands and aliases for cleaning up branches sprinkled across the internet. I'll specifically link the commands and posts shared in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/gonedark/status/1486721735621677068), [another project](https://github.com/foriequal0/git-trim) for inspiring the name, and [git-open](https://github.com/paulirish/git-open) which I used as a code reference.
